**SystemHUD** adds the following features:

IRL Date and Time
System Specs like Java Version, Vendor, Architecture, CPU and OS
Current Minecraft Version

The mod is built using Kotlin and Java 20. **It is recommended that you run Java 20 or newer**. However, you could run older versions of Java, but you may find issues.

The default date and time formatting uses CAN/CSA-Z234.4-89 (R2007), or simply ISO-8601, which is the standard for Canada. **This is intended.** However, you can change this in the mod config.

This mod requires the latest version (as of 2023-12-12) for Kotlin Programming Language, Fabric API, Cloth Config and Modmenu be installed in your mods folder.

There are no plans for backporting or Forge/Quilt
